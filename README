Based off some code a few co-workers wrote in OpenGL c++.

Currently the NetBeans (using 6.9.1) project is configured for windows.

To obtain the initial setup to allow the program to run:
  Started off with tutorial found at https://sites.google.com/site/justinscsstuff/jogl-tutorial-1, modified for NetBeans.

  Used http://jogamp.org/deployment/autobuilds/jogl-b198-2010-11-04_05-53-09/build/jogl-2.0-pre-20101104-windows-amd64.zip, (choose the appropriate arch) copied the lib directory to "C:\lib"

  Copied all the zips from http://jogamp.org/deployment/autobuilds/jogl-master-b152-2010-11-03_20-31-08/build/ into "C:\doc"

  Created a "JOGL_pre2" (Tools->Libraries) library
    Included the following jars for the Classpath :
      C:\lib\gluegen-rt.jar
      C:\lib\jogl.all.jar
      C:\lib\nativewindow.all.jar
      C:\lib\newt.all.jar
    Include the following zips for the JavaDoc :
      C:\doc\javadoc_dev.zip
      C:\doc\javadoc_jogl_spec.zip
      C:\doc\javadoc_nativewindow_spec.zip
      C:\doc\javadoc_public.zip

    Make sure the Project's Run Property has the VM option '-Djava.library.path="C:\lib"' value so it can find the needed native dlls for windows

TODO:
  Add the JUnit tests for Main class.
  Create a gui and GL context.
  Translate the Motes and ForceLine C++ code into java, and improve the Motes toy.
